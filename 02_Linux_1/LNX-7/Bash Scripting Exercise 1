### Overcome challenges
- Wrote script to install apache2 as httpd server, but the script didnâ€™t run, got the error bad interpreter: no such file or directory.
Had the syntax `#!/usr/bin/bash` as first line to execute the bash script, my team pointed out I had to remove the `/usr` bit, it ran succesfully after that. 

### Results
- Created a directory called 'scripts'.
- Added the scripts directory to the PATH variable.
- Created a script that appends a line of text to a text file whenever it was executed.
- Created a script that installed the httpd package, activated httpd, enabled httpd and printed the status of httpd in the terminal.
