# Network Devices
An introduction to network devices and how to connect these to one another.
## Key terminology
- **Network**  
A network is defined as the connection of at least two computer systems, either by a cable or a wireless connection. The simplest network is a combination of two computers connected by a cable. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.
- **Protocols**  
 A protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.
- **Network Devices**  
Network devices, or networking hardware, are physical devices that are required for communication and interaction between hardware on a computer network. A list of common network devices includes:
 **1. Hub:** A hub connects mulitple computer networking devices together. Besides this is also acts as a repeater in order to amplify signals that weaken after travelling long distyances over connecting cables. A Hub is a simple networking device, only connecting LAN components with identical protocols. 
 **2. Switch:** A multiport device that improves network efficiency over hubs or routers because of virtual circuit capability, while also improving network security because these virtual circuits are more difficult to exmine with network monitors. The switch maintains some routing information about nodes in the internal network and allows connections to systems like hubs or routers. A switch can work as either the Data Link layer or the Network layer of the OSI model, while a multilayer switch can act as both simultaneously.  
 **3. Router:** Helps tramsit packets to their destinations by helping the packets navigate the connected network devices with their different network topologies. Routers establish communication by maintaining tables about destinations and local connections. A router contains information about the systems connected to it and where to send requests if the destination isnâ€™t known. Routers usually communicate routing and other information using one of three standard protocols: *Routing Information Protocol (RIP)*, *Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)* or *Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)*. A router with added translation functionality is called a gateway.  
 **4. Bridge:** Bridges are used to connect two or more hosts or network segments together. The basic role of bridges in network architecture is storing and forwarding frames between the different segments that the bridge connects. They use hardware Media Access Control (MAC) addresses for transferring frames. By looking at the MAC address of the devices connected to each segment, bridges can forward the data or block it from crossing. Bridges can also be used to connect two physical LANs into a larger logical LAN.  
 **5. Gateway:** Gateways normally work at the Transport and Session layers of the OSI model. Gateways provide translation between networking technologies such as Open System Interconnection (OSI) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Because of this, gateways connect two or more autonomous networks, each with its own routing algorithms, protocols, topology, domain name service, and network administration procedures and policies. Gateways perform all of the functions of routers and more.The function that does the translation between different network technologies is called a protocol converter.  
 **6. Modem:** Short for Modulator-Demodulator. it is used to translate digital signals into analog signals and transmit these over analog telephone lines to another modem at the receiving location, which translates the analog signals into digital signals and outputs these to a hardware device connected to the modem.  
 **7. Repeater:** An electronic device that amplifies the signal it receives. These work on the *Physical Layer*.  
 **8. AP:** Short for access point. Commonly means a wireless device, but wired does exist. It works on the *Data Link Layer* and can operate as a bridge connecting a standard wired network to wireless devices or as a router passing data transmissions from one access point to another. Wireless access points (WAPs) consist of a transmitter and receiver (transceiver) device used to create a wireless LAN (WLAN).  Access points typically are separate network devices with a built-in antenna, transmitter and adapter. APs use the wireless infrastructure network mode to provide a connection point between WLANs and a wired Ethernet LAN. They also have several ports, giving you a way to expand the network to support additional clients. To connect to a wireless AP, you need a service set identifier (SSID) name.
 - **LAN**  
 See Networking Assigment 1. 
- **DHCP**  
Short for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, thus allowing them to use network services. A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.
- **SSID**  
Short for Service Set Identifier. It is the technical name of any network. It is also referred to as Network ID or Network Name. Devices use this name to communicate over Wi-Fi. Devices, including mobile devices and computers, find and identify wireless networks from the SSID that routers broadcast.
