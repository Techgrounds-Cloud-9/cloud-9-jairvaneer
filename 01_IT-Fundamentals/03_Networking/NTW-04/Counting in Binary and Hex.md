# Counting in Binary and Hex
Different number systems.
## Key terminology
- **Binary**  
A way of representing numbers with only two options, 0 and 1. This is a visual representation of the way a computer detects a signal (1) or no signal (0). The physical unit that either carries the signal or does not carry the signal is called a bit, and one bit is one digit in a binary number.
- **Bit**  
See NTW-02.
- **Decimal**  
A system used to represent numbers, making use of ten symbols, 0-9, with the addition of more digits as the number size increases (10, 100), but still only making use of those ten symbols.
- **Hexadecimal**  
A counting system making use of 16 symbols, 0-9 and A-F. A-F are used as single digit numbers in place of the double digit decimal numbers 10-15.
- **Base**
The number of symbols in a counting system. Binary is base 2, decimal is base 10, and hexadecimal is base 16.
