### Overcome challenges
The script with conditions was not working for the first few times. I figured out this was because of ..............

### Results  
- Created a script that generated a random number between 1-10, stored it in a variable and appended that number to a text file.
- Created a script that generated a random number between 1-10, stored it in a variable, and appended that number to a text file if it was bigger than 5. If it was 5 or smaller, the line 'It's a small number buddy' was appended to the same text file instead.
- Used two seperate commands ...........to run the script 10 times in a row, rather than inputting the command.............. to run it once multiple times to check whether the script worked.
