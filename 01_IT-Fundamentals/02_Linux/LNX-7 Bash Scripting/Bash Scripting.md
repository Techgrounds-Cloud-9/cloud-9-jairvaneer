### Overcome challenges
- Wrote script to install apache2 as httpd server, but the script didnâ€™t run, got the error bad interpreter: no such file or directory.
 The scripts were not not working for the first few times. I figured out this was because of the use of `#!/usr/bin/bash` while I should have been using `#!/bin/bash` to get the script to execute.

### Results
- Created a directory called 'scripts'.
- Added the scripts directory to the PATH variable. ![scripts added path](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%201%20-%20%231_Scripts_Directory_Path_Variable.png)
- Created a script that appends a line of text to a text file whenever it was executed. ![append line script](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%201%20-%20%232_Script_Appends_Line.png)
- Created a script that installed the httpd package, activated httpd, enabled httpd and printed the status of httpd in the terminal. ![httpd script](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%201%20-%20%233_HTTPD_Script.png) ![httpd script output](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%201%20-%20%234_Run%20HTTPD_Script.png) ![httpd script output 2](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%201%20-%20%235_Run%20HTTPD_Script.png)  
- Created a script that generated a random number between 1-10, stored it in a variable and appended that number to a text file. ![script random number](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%202%20-%20%231_Random_Number_Script.png) ![random number script output](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%202%20-%20%232_Random_Number_Textfile.png)
- Created a script that generated a random number between 1-10, stored it in a variable, and appended that number to a text file if it was bigger than 5. If it was 5 or smaller, the line 'It's a small number buddy' was appended to the same text file instead. ![conditional number script](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%203%20-%20%231_Random_Number_Bigger_Than.png) 
- Used two seperate commands, `n=0; while [[ $n -lt 10 ]]; do ./randomif.sh; n=$((n+1)); done` and `for run in {1..10}; do ./randomif.sh; done` to run the script 10 times in a row, rather than inputting the command `./randomif.sh` to run it once multiple times to check whether the script worked. ![conditional number output](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%203%20-%20%232_Random_Number_Line.png) ![conditional number output 2](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-jairvaneer/blob/651463abf8cd8f2922aaae47f99c6185784b3c61/00_includes/Sprint%201/Screenshots%20Linux/LNX-07%20Bash%20Scripting/LNX-07%20Exercise%203%20-%20%233_Random_Number_Line.png)
