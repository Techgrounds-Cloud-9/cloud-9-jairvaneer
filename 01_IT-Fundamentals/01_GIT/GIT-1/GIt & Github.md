# Subject
Git & Github
## Key terminology
- Distributed and centralised version control  
In a centralized version control system, 
- Repository  
A repositry is a virtual domain where you can store data. It contains all files and the file's history on it. In doing so, it creates a place where people can see and comment on each others work, and with the right permissions, propose changes to them.
- Main/Master  
The main branch or master branch is the central branch of your repository. 
- Branch  
A branch is a version of the repository. This can be the master/main branch, or a copy of the master branch that exist parallel to it. The changes made to the copy of the main branch in the parallel branch do not affect the main branch, until such time when they are merged.
- Commit  
A commit is a change to a file. Whenever you 'commit' to the change you made, a hash is created to record this change. In this hash,  you can find all the information regarding the change. 
- Push  
Pushing means that you send the committed changes that you made on your local machine to the remote repository that exists on Github.com.
- Pull  
Pulling means that you are receiving the commited changes from the local machine at the remote repository.
- Merge  
Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them to the branch they are merging with. These can be done either via the command line or via the GUI which in this case is the Github website.
- Fork  
A fork is a copy of another repository that you can keep on your account in order to make changes to it without affecting the original repository.

### Overcome challenges
I had some difficulty with pushing code via GitBash, but I got it to work by use of the sources.

### Results
GitHub Repository made, permissions given to teammates, code pushed to repository.
