# Git & Markdown
This assignment is about Git, a open source distributed version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. It also concerns Markdown, a markup language that is used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
## Key terminology
- **Git**   
See GIT-01. 
- **Markdown**  
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
- **Markup Language**  
A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format the overall view of a page and the data it contains. Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, Markdown, SGML, and XML. 
- **WYSIWYG**  
Short for What You See Is What You Get. WYSIWYG is a type of editing software that allows users to see and edit content in a form that appears as it would when displayed on an interface, webpage, slide presentation or printed document. WYSIWYG editors enable users to manipulate the content or layout without having to type any commands. For example, when users write a document using a word processor, it uses WYSIWYG, as what they create, format and edit is replicated in the printed document or PDF file.  
- **WYSIWYM**  
Short for What You See Is What You Mean. It is the alternative to WYSIWYG. In a WYSIWYM editor, the user writes the contents in a structured way, marking the content according to its meaning, its significance in the document, and leaves its final appearance up to one or more separate style sheets. It aims to accurately display the contents being conveyed, rather than the actual formatting associated with it.
- **VS Code**  
Short for Visual Studio Code. It is a source code and text editor that runs on your browser and supports the majority of Markup languages, including Markdown.
