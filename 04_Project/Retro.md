# Cloud Crowd Retro of Week 11

## What went well?
 - Progress was steady, because of teamwork. 
- A lot of fun, one of the most intesive collaborations in the sprints, very productive. 
- A lot of interesting copnversations, sharing resources, discussing problems.
- We had a really good click, and everybody was willing to help another, point them in the right direction or take a look at errors that we encountered.

## What could have gone better?
 - We would like more time to fully understand all concepts, because due to the sometimes limited documentation on the part of AWS some concepts are harder to grasp, while we do want a full understanding of the CDK. 

## What can we do to improve?
 - As this was an individual assignment, it is quite difficult to look at possible improvements from a team perspective. But we would like some better documentation from AWS on how to use their resources!
