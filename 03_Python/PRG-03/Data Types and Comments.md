### Overcome challenges


### Results
- Determined the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using function `type()`.
- By adding the command `float()` to the variables b and d, I changed both data types to floats. Running the script didnt present the same error but instead returned the value `25.5` for the variable `x`.
- Wrote comments above every line of code tho tell what is going on in my script.  
- Created a new script that let the user input values when asked `input here`, and then told the data type of the user input. Inputting words or numbers steadily returned `<class 'str'>`, showing that the user input was a string every time.
