### Overcome challenges
I unintentionally created the python test file in the wrong folder, so running the code failed the first few times. When retracing my steps, I found the file in the wrong folder and corrected the mistake.

### Results
- Installed Python extension for VS Code.  
- Printed `Hello World` in the terminal
