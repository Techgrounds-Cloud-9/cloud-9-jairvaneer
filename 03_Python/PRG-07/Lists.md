### Overcome challenges
First figured out how to create the list of consecutive summation by indexing the numbers, but wanted to find a way how to do that without specifiyng them. Finally figured out the way by using `len` function.

### Results
- Created the script with a variable that contained a list of five names. Using a for loop, I printed every individual name in the list on a new line.  
- Created a new script with a list of five integers. Used a for loop to print the value of every item added to the value of the next item in the list. If it is the last item, it was added to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).  
- Found two alternative ways to do this.
