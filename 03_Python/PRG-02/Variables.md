### Overcome challenges
- I have now learned to save in between steps before running the code.
- It took me some time to learn how to use the `+` sign in python, but by trial and error I got it.
- I printed the code in exercise 3 to the terminal, so had to redo that, successfully.

### Results
- Created a new script with variables `x=5` and `y=7`. Printing these gave values `5`and `7`.
- Created a new variable `z=x+y`. Printing this gave value `12`.
- Created a script with variable name and printed the text `Hello, Ja√Ør!`
- Created a script with changing values for variable `x`.
