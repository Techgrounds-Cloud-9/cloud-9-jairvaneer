### Overcome challenges
- In exercise 1, I named my python file "random.py" but that gave an error I was not familiar with. When I renamed the file to "rndm.py" it worked. 
- In exercise 2, I forgot to add the exclamation mark at the end of the function with string with exercise 2 the firstr time, corrected that oversight the second time.
- In exercise 3, I forgot to add `return z` at the end of the function.


### Results
- Created a new script, imported the random package and printed out five random integers with a value between 0 and 100. I did this in 2 ways, on ewhere I repeated the smae print request five times, and one where I told the script to run one line five times.  
- Wrote a custom function myfunction() that printed “Hello, world!” to the terminal when called. After this, I rewrote the function so that it took a string as an argument.
- Wrote the custom function avg() in such a way that it returned the average of the given parameters.
