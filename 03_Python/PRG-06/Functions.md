### Overcome challenges
I named my python file "random.py" but that gave an error I was not familiar with. When I renamed the file to "rndm.py" it worked. I forgot to add the exclamation mark at the end of the function with string with exercise 2 the firstr time, corrected that oversight the second time


### Results
- Created a new script, imported the random package and printed out five random integers with a value between 0 and 100. I did this in 2 ways, on ewhere I repeated the smae print request five times, and one where I told the script to run one line five times.
