# Group 3 Retro of Week 1
Sait Baser  
Jeena Marath Premkumar  
Kevin Donk  
Ja√Ør van Eer (scrum master)



## What went well?
 - We took the time to individually work on our assignments. At the same time, we agreed upon times were we would return to the zoom call to talk about our work, like working in mini sprints. This went very well, as we had an agreed-upon time were we cold ask questions and help each other out, and the rest of the time we could work on our personal growth.

## What could have gone better?
 - On the first day we didnt really have a structure of work, both as a group and as an individual.
 - We could be working more efficient by putting our notes in Markdown straightaway.

## What can we do to improve?
 - Structure our group work more. This went better from the second day on.
 - Put our notes in Markdown straightwaway while working on the assignments.
