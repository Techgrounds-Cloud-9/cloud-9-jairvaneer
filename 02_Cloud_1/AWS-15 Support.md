- **Trusted Advisor**  
AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks. These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. You can then follow the recommendations to optimize your services and resources. AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers can access core security checks and checks for service quotas. AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers can access all checks, including cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service quotas.  
Trusted advisor is a AWS service which monitors the deviation from the AWS best practices and reports to the admin. It keeps and eye on cost saving, security enhancement, performance tuning and reliability. The recommendation provided by trusted advisor helps you configure the AWS infrastructure more robust.
