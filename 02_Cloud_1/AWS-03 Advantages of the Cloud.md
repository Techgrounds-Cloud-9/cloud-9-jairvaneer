# Advantages of the Cloud
This Assignment covers the advantages of the cloud as listed by AWS. 
## Key terminology
- **Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx)**  
 Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before knowing how these are going to be used, customers can pay only when they consume computing resources, and pay only for how much they consume.
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**  
By using cloud computing, customers achieve a lower variable cost because they split the bill with thousands of other AWS customers. Because all the customer usage is aggregated, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which results in lower pay-as-ou-go prices.
- **Stop guessing capacity**  
Cloud computing eliminates guessing the customers infrastructure needs, often ending up with either too much or too little. With cloud computing, customers can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutesâ€™ notice.
- **Increase speed and agility**  
In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
- **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers**  
Customers can stop spending money on servers and data centers and instead focus time and money on their clients.
- **Go global in minutes**  
Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
