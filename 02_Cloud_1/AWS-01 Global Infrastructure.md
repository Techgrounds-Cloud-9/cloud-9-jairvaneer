# Global Infrastructure


## Key terminology
- **AWS Availability Zone**  
Availability Zones are locations within an AWS Region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. They also provide cheap connections to other Availability Zones.
- **Regions**  
AWS Regions cover large areas and are dispersed into seperate geographic locations. Each region ios completely independent, meaning that there is no connectioon to other regions. Therefore, picking a region is an iportant choice for a customer.
- **Edge Location**  
Edge Locations are data centers close to the customer. They are closer to the customer than Regions or Availability Zones, and are key in reducing latency and improving user experience.
- **IAM**  
Short for Identity and Access Management. With this, you can specify who or what can access services an features in AWS.  
- **RDS**  
Short for Relational Database Service is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud

- There are four main factors to consider when picking a region.  
**1. Compliance:** If your workload contains data that is bound by local regulations, it is imperative that you pick a Region that complies with those regulations. Therefore, this factor trumps all others.  
**2. Latency:** Choosing a Region in the vicinity of your user base can result in reduced latency, which enhances user experience.  
**3. Cost:** Regions are priced differently.
**4. Services and features:** While all Regions have the same SLA (Service Level Agreement), some larger Regions are usually first to offer newer services, features and software releases.  
So, based on these four metrics you would pick one region over the other.
