# IAM
Short for Identity and Access Management. This service is used to specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS. It offers one centrally managed spot where a record can be viewed of permissions and these permissions can be refined and adapted.  
If you use AWS CloudTrail, you receive log records that include information about those who made requests for resources in your account. That information is based on IAM identities.
## Key terminology
- **IAM Identity Centre**  
- **IAM Resources**  
The user, group, role, policy, and identity provider objects that are stored in IAM. As with other AWS services, you can add, edit, and remove resources from IAM.
- **IAM Identities**  
The IAM resource objects that are used to identify and group. You can attach a policy to an IAM identity. These include users, groups, and roles.
- **IAM Entities**
The IAM resource objects that AWS uses for authentication. These include IAM users and roles.
- **Principals**
A person or application that uses the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role to sign in and make requests to AWS. Principals include federated users and assumed roles.  
A principal is a person or application that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. The principal is authenticated as the AWS account root user or an IAM entity to make requests to AWS. As a best practice, do not use your root user credentials for your daily work. Instead, create IAM entities (users and roles). You can also support federated users or programmatic access to allow an application to access your AWS account.
