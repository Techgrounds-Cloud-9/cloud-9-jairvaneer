# Pricing
This assignment deals with the pricing model of AWS and how moving to the cloud can reduce costs compared to traditional data centers.
## Key terminology
- **AWS Pricing Model**  
The pricing model of AWS for their services. You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees. AWS identifies four major advantages to their pricing model, which will be discussed hereafter.  
- **Pay-as-you-go**  
Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes. With a pay as you go model, you can adapt your business depending on need and not on forecasts, reducing the risk or overprovisioning or missing capacity and making your business fully elastic.
- **Save when you commit**  
Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that provides significant savings on your AWS usage. This pricing model offers lower prices on AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning. Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount (measured in $/hour) of an AWS service or a category of services, for a one- or three-year period.
- **Pay less by using more**  
ou can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free of charge. As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that allow you to increase adoption and keep costs under control.
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
- **Amazon S3**  
Short for Amazon Simple Storage Service. This is an object storage service offering scalability, data availability, security, and performance.  
- **Amazon EC2**  
Short for Amazong Elastic Compute Cloud. This service offers a compute platform for your workload, where the customer can decide on storgae, networking, operating system and more.  
- **AWS RDS**  
See AWS-01.
- **AWS Free Tier**  
The AWS Free Tier provides customers the ability to explore and try out AWS services free of charge up to specified limits for each service. Some of the services like Amazon EC2, Amazon Cloudfront, Amazon S3 are free for a 12 month period, some like Amazom DynamoDB, Amazon Chime are always free, and others like Amazon Redshift, Amazon Lightsail have short term free trials, typically 30-60 days.
- **AWS Always Free**  
These are certain AWS services that are always free to use, as long as you are an AWS customer.
- **CapEx**  
Short for Capital Expenditure. This term is used to denote the business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future. In iT, items such as servers, computers, printers and scanners are items that fall under this category.
- **OpEx**  
Short for Operating Expenditure. Thses are your operating costs, the expenses to run day-to-day business. This includes printer cartridges and paper, electricity, and even yearly services like website hosting or domain registrations.  
- **GET request**  
A GET request is the act of requesting of file retrieval. In the S3 free tier, customers can request up to 20.000 files monthly from their storage.  
- **PUT request**  
A PUT request creates a resource or updates an existing resource. In the S3 free tier, customers can make up to 2000 monthly PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST requests.  
- **COPY request**  
A COPY request copies a piece of data. In the S3 free tier, customers can make up to 2000 monthly PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST requests.  
- **POST request**  
The POST request method requests that a web server accept the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it. It is often used when uploading a file or when submitting a completed web form. In the S3 free tier, customers can make up to 2000 monthly PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST requests.  
- **LIST request**  
The LIST request retrieves a list of records from the specified database or data set. The first entry in the list is made available for processing. In the S3 free tier, customers can make up to 2000 monthly PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST requests.

### Overcome challenges
- No challenges, just learning.

### Results
- Studied the four advantages of the AWS pricing model.  
- The AWS S3 Free tier offers 12 months of free use of the data storage device. You can store up to 5 GB of data. Customers also receive 20.00 GET requests;  2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests; and 100 GB of Data Transfer Out each month.  
- The AWS EC2 Free Tier offers 750 hours per month of Linux and Windows t2.micro instances (t3.micro for the regions in which t2.micro is unavailable), each month for one year.  
-  AWS Always Free Services are described in the key terminology section of this assignment.
- The difference between CapEx and OpEx is the longevity of the investment. CapEx is focused on long-term future benefits, whereas OpEx is focused on short term expenses. When considering the cloud, a company that wants to avoid the difficulties of capital expenditure will opt for public cloud services that use a pay as you go model.   
A company that wants total control of cloud services within your company would hire an in-house IT team specialized in cloud to set up a private cloud where your organization is totally responsible for its services and costs. This is an organization that is willing to take on the financial responsibility that capital expenditure brings with itself in order to exert total control and reap future benefits.  
The third option is a hybrid model, which combines resources from both private and public clouds to create a hybrid cloud when your organization buys a public cloud and makes your IT team responsible for it. This option offers the most flexibility for controlling costs.
