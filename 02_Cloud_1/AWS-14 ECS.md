# ECS
Short for Elastic Container Service. This is Amazons container service, which is used to run containerized apps and programs
## Key terminology
- **Container**  
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. They are made from imbedding code in container images. AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) integrate seamlessly with Amazon ECS.
- **Container Image**  
A static file with executable code that can create a container on a computing system. It is immutable (unchangeable) and can be deployed consistenly in any environment. These are similar to instructions or a blueprint of the container.
- **AWS Fargate**  
Serverless containers service in charge of easy scaling and running containers.
- **AWS EKS**  
Short for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. As ECS, it is a fully managed container service. However, where ECS is lauded for its simplicity, EKS is for its flexibility. Developers have much more options with EKS, as it provides you not only with a container service(container runtime) but with a platform for running and managing containers from many container runtimes.
